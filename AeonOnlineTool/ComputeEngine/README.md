# Compute Engine for the Biodivine/Aeon Online Tool

This directory contains precompiled Compute Engines for various operating systems. If you cannot find a compatible Compute Engine for your OS, you can compile one yourself by following the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-aeon-server">Biodivine Aeon Server GitHub repository</a>.

## Setup guide

All precompiled Compute Engines must be extracted (unzipped) before use.

### Linux (x86-64)

To run this version of Compute Engine, you need a Linux distribution with an x86-64 architecture.

Run the Compute Engine: After unzipping, navigate to the folder and run the compute-engine file.

Fix Permissions (if necessary): If you encounter a permission error, you may need to update the permissions of the compute-engine file. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

    chmod +x compute-engine

After updating the permissions, you can try running the compute-engine file again.

### Windows (x86-64)

To run this version of Compute Engine, you need a Windows distribution with an x86-64 architecture.

Run the Compute Engine: After unzipping, navigate to the folder and run the compute-engine file.

Bypass Security Warning: Windows may flag the executable as a potential security risk and display a warning message. If this happens:

1) Look for a "Run" button in the warning window.

2) If you don't see it immediately, you may need to click a "Show More" or "More Info" button to reveal the option to run the application.

3) Click the Run button, and the Compute Engine should start.

### MacOS (x86-64 - Intel-based)

To run  this version of Compute Engine on MacOS with an x86-64 architecture (Intel-based Macs, not Apple M processors).

Run the Compute Engine: After unzipping, navigate to the folder and run the compute-engine file.

Bypass Security Warning: MacOS may block the execution of the file if it is from an unidentified developer. If this happens:

1) Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy.

2) Under the General tab, look for a message saying the compute-engine was blocked.

3) Click Open Anyway, and the Compute Engine should run.

### MacOS (arm64 - Apple Silicon)

To run  this version of Compute Engine on MacOS with an arm64 (aarch64) architecture (Apple Silicon M processors).

Run the Compute Engine: After unzipping, navigate to the folder and run the compute-engine file.

Bypass Security Warning: MacOS may block the execution of the file if it is from an unidentified developer. If this happens:

1) Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy.

2) Under the General tab, look for a message saying the compute-engine was blocked.

3) Click Open Anyway, and the Compute Engine should run.
