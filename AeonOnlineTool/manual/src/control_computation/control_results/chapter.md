This section outlines the features Aeon provides for analyzing and managing the results of control computations. Aeon offers various visualization methods and export options to facilitate the interpretation and further use of computed perturbations.

Both visualization and export options are available in the Results module. This module opens automatically after a successful computation and can also be accessed by clicking the corresponding button in the left panel.
