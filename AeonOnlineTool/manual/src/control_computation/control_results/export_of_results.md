# Export of Control Results

The export functionality in the Results module allows saving computed control results for further analysis and use outside Aeon. Currently, Aeon supports exporting results in the following formats:

## CSV (.csv)

The CSV format provides a structured, tabular representation of the computed control perturbations, making it easy to process the data in spreadsheet applications or external analysis tools.
