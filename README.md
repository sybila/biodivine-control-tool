# Biodivine/Aeon Online Tool

Biodivine/Aeon Online Tool is a web-based application for performing operations on Boolean networks (both fully and partially defined). It allows users to modify networks, perform attractor analysis, and compute control strategies.

## Overview

The tool consists of two main components:

**Frontend:** The web interface for interacting with the tool (located in the OnlineTool directory).
    
**Backend:** The Compute Engine, which processes the data and executes operations (located in the ComputeEngine directory).

## Setup guide

To get the application running, you need to download both components and run them simultaneously.

1) Download the Components

**Frontend:** Download the entire OnlineTool directory. This contains the web-based user interface for the application.
    
**Backend:** Download one of the precompiled Compute Engines from the ComputeEngine directory. This will handle the backend operations.

2) Run the Components

To run the application, you need to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously. Detailed instructions for setting up and running both the frontend and backend can be found in the README files within their respective directories.

Once both are running, the tool will be fully functional.
